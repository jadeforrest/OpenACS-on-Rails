== Welcome to OpenACS on Rails

Welcome to OpenACS on Rails. This is a personal project of mine to
move a couple of websites to Rails. I am keeping the data model until
the site is in a state which is stable enough for deployment. Then I
make no promises.
    
Note that this fork is based off of OpenACS 5.2.3 on Postgres.
However, I think we can probably do meaningful collaboration even
based on different versions of OpenACS. Fortunately, git does make
forking much less painful that it has been in the past.
    
I used the Magic Model Generator to generate a first version of the
models.
