== Welcome to OpenACS on Rails

Welcome to OpenACS on Rails. This is a personal project of mine to
move a couple of websites to Rails. I am keeping the data model until
the site is in a state which is stable enough for deployment. Then I
make no promises.
    
Note that this fork is based off of OpenACS 5.2.3 on Postgres.
However, I think we can probably do meaningful collaboration even
based on different versions of OpenACS. Fortunately, git does make
forking much less painful that it has been in the past.
    
I used the Magic Model Generator to generate a first version of the
models.

== Todo

* Plugin to support OpenACS object model

This looks surprisingly easy. Just a lot of finangling to get the
interface to work nicely.

I probably will not add in support for the permissions data model,
although it wouldn't be that hard.

This plugin will be the most important code to fork off for any other
migration efforts. I envision putting something in the model akin to
"acts_as_openacs", with the list of fields to save to match up with
the appropriate pl/sql functions, and then save, update, etc.. works
pretty automatically.

One element that may be harder is code that uses the Content
Repository. That will need to be duplicated as well. Probably it will
be something like "acts_as_versioned_openacs" or something like that.
